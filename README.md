# Welcome! 

## The name of this application is called: Cook What!?

*All recipes and ingredients used are sourced from the below API*:

--------

This website is designed to help users see the potential recipes they can craft from ingredients they already have in their homes. Most people who don't cook often or even those who do still may not realize the infinite possibilites when it comes to coooking.

Cook What simply allows user to create a "fridge" when logged-in and add in ingredients they have in there home. 

Once the fridge is filled with the base ingredients you find necessary, the user will the be able to to select the option to search for recipes that include ingredients listed in the users fridge. 

From breakfast sandwiches to unique cocktails, there's endless combinations to choose from!

I personally am passionate when it comes to cooking. Ever since the pandemic hit hard, I've spent allot of time cooking at home and learning new recipes. I still find myself drawing blanks even when I have a full pantry/fridge. 

Further iterations of this application may include filters(nutrition facts, ignore basic ingredients, quanitity of results), saving favorited ingredients, and searching by recipe name.
