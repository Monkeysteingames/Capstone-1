This website is designed to help users see the potential recipes they can craft from ingredients they already have in their homes. Most people who don't cook often or even those who do still may not realize the infinite possibilities when it comes to cooking.

Cook What simply allows users to create a "fridge" when logged in and add in ingredients they have in their home. 

Once the fridge is filled with the base ingredients you find necessary, the user will be able to select the option to search for recipes that include ingredients listed in the user's fridge. 

From breakfast sandwiches to unique cocktails, there are endless combinations to choose from!

I personally am passionate when it comes to cooking. Ever since the pandemic hit hard, I've spent a lot of time cooking at home and learning new recipes. I still find myself drawing blanks even when I have a full pantry/fridge. 

Further iterations of this application may include filters(nutrition facts, ignore basic ingredients, the number of results), saving favorited ingredients, and searching by recipe name.
